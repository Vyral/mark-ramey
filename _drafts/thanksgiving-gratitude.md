{% include youtube.html %}Today I’m sharing GEMs—a tool I use every day to help me experience a more peaceful life.

It’s Thanksgiving time, and I wanted to share something that has helped me in my life. It’s all wrapped around a daily habit of gratitude. Each day when I wake up I spend time writing in my journal. I do something my mentor shared with me called GEMs. This stands for gratitude, experience, and manifestations.&nbsp;

Since I’ve been writing these over the last few years, it has helped me bring incredible things into my life. Since this small, powerful tool has helped me, out of gratitude for all of you, I wanted to share it:

**Gratitude.** Each morning I write in my journal what I’m grateful for. I’ve learned that it’s impossible for me to have an experience of gratitude at the same time as fear. So, I also use this as a tool. If there’s ever anything that’s on my mind that may be causing me not to sleep, I write it down as a gratitude, and it causes that fear to dissipate.

**Experience.** Next, I write what I want to experience for the day. For example, that might sound like: “Today I intend to experience peace, clarity, focus, and joy.”

**Manifestations.** These are the material things and those that are meaningful to our lives and the lives of the people around us. For example, that might sound like: “Today I intend to manifest three listings from great clients.”&nbsp;

At this time of the year, it’s important to express gratitude to the people who are significant to me, like you. I wish you all a happy Thanksgiving\!

If you have any further questions about GEMs or concerning real estate, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to help you with whatever you need.
