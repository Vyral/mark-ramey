<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here are the most obvious signs that it’s time for you to move.</em></p>

Oftentimes, I’ll have friends and clients ask me if the time is right for them to move. **Instead of trying to time your move based on market conditions, you need to look at the signs inside your own life for answers.** Here are the most common signs that it’s time to move:

**1. Career change.** Is it your first job out of college, a new job, or a new promotion? Perhaps you’re ending your career in retirement. Either way, a transition like this often necessitates a move.

**2. Starting a family.** Perhaps love is in the air and you’re engaged or married. Kids on the way (or more kids if you already have them) often means more space is needed.

**3. Home improvement bug.** Have you caught it? If you're not happy where you are, maybe you need to go somewhere else. You could find that next house that doesn’t need a lot of work to become a dream home instead of an existing home that does.

If it’s the time for you to move or you’re still a little unsure, feel free to reach out with any questions. I’d love to catch up with you. Just give me a call or send a quick email today. Wishing you the best.
