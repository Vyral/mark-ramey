When is the best time for you to sell a home? To get a clear answer to this question, we have to look at it from three different perspectives, which we’ll discuss today.

First, **consider the seasonality of the market.** In many markets, the time of the year makes a huge difference. Different markets have different climates, after all. Since Orlando has really nice weather all year long, we’ve found that historically, Orlando’s sales stay consistent throughout the year.

Second, **consider the market’s inventory.** The level of available inventory can affect a buyer’s timeline and budget. A neutral market with six months of inventory will have more normalized pricing and won’t be as high-stakes for buyers. A seller’s market with less than six months of inventory will typically be more competitive for buyers since prices tend to rise. In a buyer’s market with more than six months of inventory, home values tend to decline.

Third, **consider the relativity of the market.** If you’re planning to sell your home in a seller’s market, that means you’re also planning to buy in a seller’s market. If you’re buying in a buyer’s market, chances are you’re planning to sell a home in a buyer’s market as well.

Ultimately, the ideal time for you to sell your home is when it serves your needs. If you have any questions or would like to discuss if now is the right time for you to sell, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to help you.
