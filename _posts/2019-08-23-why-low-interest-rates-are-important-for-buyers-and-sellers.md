Low interest rates are good for buyers, but they’re also good for sellers. Here’s why.

When we’re talking about interest rates, their importance really comes down to one thing: Affordability. **For every point that interest rates go up or down, it affects the buying power of buyers by 10%.**&nbsp;

For example, if you are approved for $300,000 and interest rates go down by 1%, you can now afford $330,000. **That’s significant.**

What does this mean for home sellers? **Essentially, it means there are more buyers and more competition for your home.** This gives you a greater chance of receiving multiple offers and being able to negotiate from a position of strength. This will also allow you to choose the best price and the best terms.&nbsp;

If you’re a buyer, you still have to be in a position where you can compete effectively. **You need to be working with a good agent who is going to make sure you win and give you a competitive advantage in the market.**
