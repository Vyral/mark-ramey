Does it make more sense to sell your home now or wait until spring? Here’s what I think.

If you want to sell your home, should you start the process now or wait until spring? I’m here to answer this question today.

We’re in Orlando, which means we don’t have the snow and other cold weather conditions that can affect our market. As a result, we pretty much have an even flow of buyers throughout the year. There are some slight peaks and valleys. **For example, we typically have a little bit lower inventory around this time of year.**&nbsp;

Lower inventory means buyers have less to choose from. When there's less to choose from, those truly motivated buyers can tend to be a little more emotional. **Less competition and more emotional buyers typically equal a higher sales price for a home.**

A warmly decorated home around the holidays can create a fantastic effect when it comes to staging and showing.&nbsp;

On the flip side of these benefits, you may simply not want your holiday festivities with your family interrupted, so you'll have to consider that, too.

**Let’s say that you want to wait until spring, what will you find there?** Typically there will be more buyers, and there will be yard in full bloom, but there will be more inventory as well.

If you have any other questions for me about when the best time for you to buy or sell a home is, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
