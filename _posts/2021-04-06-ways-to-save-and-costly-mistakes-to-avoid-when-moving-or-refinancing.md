When you’re refinancing your home or moving to a new one, it’s possible to make some very costly mistakes. Fortunately, today I’ll be showing you what these pitfalls are and giving you tips on how to avoid them.

Some of my clients have had very valuable possessions get damaged while moving to a new home because the items weren’t properly packed. It’s important to make sure you are packing things well so they don’t shift, fall, and break while you’re on the road. If you’re thinking about hiring movers, contact us first; **we can put you in touch with a trustworthy company that we’ve vetted ourselves.**

Another thing I see happen is that people forget to cancel homeowners insurance policies after they move. Recently, a client who closed on a house six months ago reached out to me for this very reason. You may think canceling is a no-brainer, but the whirlwind nature of buying a new home makes it easy to forget.

**When refinancing, there are two ways you can get some money back.** The first has to do with closing out your old mortgage and refinancing with a new lender. You will still have an escrow account that includes tax payments, insurance payments, and other items you paid into your old mortgage. By switching to a new lender, you should get the money from the escrow account refunded within 30 days of closing or refinancing.

The second has to do with Keller Mortgage. If you’ve been using my real estate app, you already have access to this program. Essentially, **Keller Mortgage helps you save thousands of dollars because there are no lender fees** and you are given a $1,000 credit at closing. Another great program inside the app is called Keller Coverage. It allows you to shop for different insurance companies and compare what each one has to offer. It saves money because it will find a plan tailor-made for your home’s unique needs.

These are just a few ways you can save money and avoid costly mistakes when moving or refinancing. If you have any questions or would like more information regarding real estate, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
