Here is a quick list of some systems in your home that could cost you a ton by being defective or outdated:

**1\. Plumbing.** There are two types of systems that could be a risk in your home today. The first is polybutylene. There is a class-action lawsuit against this type of plumbing put in homes frequently between the late 80s and early 90s. The lawsuit has been paid out completely, so if you still have this stuff in your home, you run the risk of leaks and even being dropped by your insurance carrier. If someone buys your home, they may be at risk of not being able to have insurance at all.

**The second plumbing issue is copper.** In the state of Florida, copper is very prevalent. We’re the lighting capital of the world, and lighting causes copper to thin and leak over time. You’ll want to check with your plumber to see what they’re using today so you can keep functionality high and your costs low.

**2\. Electrical.** The first thing that often comes up on home inspections is Federal Pacific boxes. Half of the time the breakers will blow when overloaded, and half of the time they can cause a fire. This is a safety risk that affects your insurance rates and the future insurability of your home.

Additionally, aluminum wiring is a product that was put in homes mostly during the 1970s. Many insurance companies will not insure a home with aluminum wiring, and it’s a very expensive fix to remedy.

**3\. Older home risks.** Asbestos shingles can cause cancer and are very difficult to remove. If your home was built after 1978, there is no risk for lead-based paint. If it wasn’t, you may want to have your home tested for that as well.

I trust this information has been helpful for you in knowing what’s in your home so that your family is safe and what may be in the home you end up purchasing so you don’t make a costly mistake.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
