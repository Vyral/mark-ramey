<p style="text-align: center;"><em>During your home search, there are four main indicators that will help you determine whether a listing is a good deal. We’ll be discussing each of these signs today.</em></p>

When it comes time to purchase a property, how can you be sure that the home you’re looking at is a good deal? There are actually a few specific indicators, and we’ll be covering four of the best signs today:

**1. Price.** How much a home costs obviously has a lot to do with whether it's a good deal. Partnering with a quality agent and a professional lender will help you discern what kind of price is fair and what you should expect to pay for the kind of home you want.&nbsp;

**2. Home features.** During your search, you should have a list of features that you’re looking for. Having this list in mind will help you determine how well a given property meets your wants and needs. Better still, have your agent perform a comparative market analysis, during which they will compare a given home against other similar properties in order to assess its value.

**3. Location.** While you can change certain features of a home, you cannot change its location. You should always consider the ways in which a home’s location will impact your life while you live there before making the decision to purchase it.

**4. Condition.** Buying a home that is move-in ready is something many people prefer, but others still would rather put in the work to customize and fix up whatever home they buy. In either case, make a decision at the beginning of your home search about what you’re looking for. A home’s condition is a crucial component all buyers must consider.&nbsp;
