Is buying really better than renting? We think it is, so that’s what we’ll explore today. Here are three important reasons why buying is better than renting:

**1\. You're paying your own mortgage instead of your landlord’s.** Your monthly payment actually builds your equity if you own a home.

**2\. You can make the home your own.** If you want to paint the whole house purple, you have every right to do so. In a rental, you need to get the landlord's permission to make even simple changes.

**3\. You have financial freedom at the end of your mortgage.** The sooner that your home is paid for, the sooner you can redirect those financial resources into other things that are important to you, like vacations, your kids' education, retirement, and investing.

I hope this information helps you make a decision about buying a home. If you have any questions, please consider us a resource and call us at (407) 270-0011. One of our team members will be happy to answer your questions.
