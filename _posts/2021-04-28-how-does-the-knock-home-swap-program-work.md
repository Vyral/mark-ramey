What’s the best way to buy a home in a market where inventory is so low? It might just be our newest program: Knock Home Swap. **Here’s how it works:**

It starts with a fully underwritten pre-approval. Then you’ll get your down payment advance for your next home purchase so you can start making offers right away. We can help you identify your dream home and put together a winning offer with no contingencies on the sale of your current home. **This gives you an edge when it comes to competing with other offers.** Knock will also make all the previous payments on your old house while you move into your next home.

The next step is selling your old house. Knock will prepay up to $25,000 from your home’s equity to help pay for repairs to get the home in its best possible showing condition so you can sell for top dollar.
