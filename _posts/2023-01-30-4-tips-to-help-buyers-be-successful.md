As we're moving into a very active market, how can buyers ensure that their offers get accepted by the sellers? Today I am sharing four tips to help buyers win:&nbsp;

**1\. Get pre-approved for a loan.** Make sure your lender includes a completed pre-approval letter that shows they have checked your credit, income, and assets. This letter will make you a stronger buyer and help you stand out.&nbsp;

**2\. Build up your savings.** Save as much money as possible so you can have a larger down payment, as that is very attractive to sellers. This will help you if you are competing with another buyer.

**3\. Do your homework.** Know in advance which inspector you’ll be using and which insurance company you’ll go to for your homeowner’s insurance. Then you can schedule things efficiently and shorten your lending period, which is attractive to sellers.&nbsp;

**4\. Form a relationship with the seller.** Even though the seller has found their next home and is moving on, they still have formed years of memories in this house. If they can interact with you and know that the home would go to someone meaningful and who will value it, that will help you stand out a lot. This emotional connection will help you win.&nbsp;

I realize this is a lot of information and you might have a lot of questions. As they come up, call or email me anytime, and know that I would love to help you.&nbsp;
