Many of my clients want to know how the rise in interest rates and surging inflation will affect the market. Today I’ll respond to these concerns by covering a few important market updates that all buyers and sellers should know about.&nbsp;

{% include pullquote.html %}

At the beginning of the year, we had rates that were as low as 2.7%. Now rates are as high as 6%. For buyers, this means that they can afford less of a home compared to the beginning of the year. Due to this, sellers can expect fewer buyers competing for their homes. Inventory has risen 44% last month. **With more inventory and fewer buyers, we are now shifting into a buyer’s market.&nbsp;**

As for whether we’re in a recession or not, you have to remember that a recession is defined as two-quarters back-to-back of negative GDP. We had a negative GDP during the first quarter of the year, but the statistics for June aren't out yet. We’ll have to wait and see by the end of the month.&nbsp;

If you have more questions about the real estate market, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’ll be happy to help\!
