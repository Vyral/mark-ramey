Home staging pays for itself because of these three facts.

Here are three reasons why staging your home is a benefit to your home sale:

**1\. Buyers will pay more.** According to a recent survey by Moritz Research, 63% of homebuyers would be willing to pay a higher price for a home that is staged well and in good condition.

**2\. You can stand out among the competition.** A properly staged home is particularly important in a market with a lot of inventory.

**3\. We can broaden the market.** When a home is staged, it appeals to more buyers. The more buyers it appeals to, the more showings and offers.

If you have questions for me about these staging tips or anything else related to real estate, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
