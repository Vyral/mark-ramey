<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here are three mistakes to avoid when selling your home.</em></p>

When it comes to selling a home, sometimes we don’t know the finer points of how to go about it. Here are three mistakes to avoid when selling your house:

**1\. Asking too much.** When a property is priced too high it tends to sit on the market. When a home sits on the market for an extended period, longer than what is common for the market, buyers begin to ask their Realtors questions about it. What’s wrong with the house? Is the home overpriced? These buyers may not even give your house a chance.

**2\. Advertising too little.** We can’t advertise enough in today’s market to ensure no stone is unturned to find you the right buyer.

**3\. Not making a good first impression.** You want to make sure your home shows well so people will want to purchase it. 98% of our buyers want a house they can simply move into and live in right away. So, your home must make a great first impression.
