Which renovations should you make if you plan to stay in your home for a while? Let’s find out.

Which renovations are worth making to your home? Actually, the answer depends on whether you plan to keep it or sell it, **so we’ll be covering each scenario in a two-part video series.** For today’s message, which marks the first half of this series, we’ll talk about the renovations you should make if you plan to continue living in your home for some time.

**First on our list are kitchen and bathroom renovations.** Installing a new kitchen or bathroom is one of the best investments you can make for your personal lifestyle and enjoyment. Adding new flooring throughout your home can also be a wise move, as can installing a new HVAC system. Both of these things will increase your level of comfort while living in the home.&nbsp;

Finally, **consider creating a more functional outdoor living space and working on your landscaping.** These renovations, which can be done relatively inexpensively, can make a big difference in the look and feel of your home.

If you’d like to learn about the renovations you should make if you plan to sell, stay tuned for part two. Otherwise, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
