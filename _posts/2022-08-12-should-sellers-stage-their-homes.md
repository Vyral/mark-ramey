When selling their houses, homeowners often ask me if it’s worth it to stage. The purpose of staging is to highlight the property’s floor plan and allow buyers to see the potential of the living space. Properly staging your home can attract more buyers to your listing and even help you net more money—so yes, it is worth it from a financial perspective. Today I’ll share three staging tips to help you put more money in your pocket when you sell.

**1\. Declutter**. This entails clearing off all flat surfaces like tables and countertops. Bookshelves should be minimalized, and closets should be organized to open up the space in your home.

**2\. Furniture placement.** Tactfully organizing your furniture maximizes space and creates perceived value. It also shows buyers how your home’s space can be used, enabling them to imagine living there. With the advancement of technology, it’s even possible to stage an empty home by adding furniture and decorations to listing photos.

**3\. Decoration**. When I ask appraisers what sellers can do to get them the biggest bang for their buck, they don’t recommend redoing the kitchen or ripping out the bathroom—the best return on investment comes from painting and having nice floors. Adding a fresh coat of paint throughout the house, putting in fresh carpeting, and installing new light fixtures can boost your home’s value on the market.
