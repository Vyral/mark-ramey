<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’ve got a short and sweet market update for you today. Here’s what you need to know.</em></p>

Today I am going to give you a mid-year review on our real estate market to give you a better idea of what’s going on. Here’s what you need to know.

**Inventory is low right now.** While six months of inventory is considered a balanced market, we have about a 2.7-month supply in our market right now. **This tells us that we’re in a seller’s market, which is great news for homeowners.** In a seller’s market, prices are driven up. When you couple that with a drop in interest rates, you can see how our market is being fueled for sellers.

**Because inventory is so low, we’re having a difficult time finding homes for some of the families that we’re working with.** Could you or someone you know benefit from selling right now? If so, we might already have some eager buyers who are interested in a home like yours.

If you have any questions about the latest numbers and what they mean for you, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
