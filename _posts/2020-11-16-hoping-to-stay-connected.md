I’m reaching out to you today just to remind you why I send you my videos about various real estate topics.

Some of you are receiving one of my videos for the first time, and to you, I apologize. I recently discovered as we went through our list of clients that there were a number of people who weren’t included to receive these videos from my blog. I’m truly very sorry about that.

The purpose of these videos is to provide you with valuable information and answer any questions about our community or real estate in general—why else would you watch them?&nbsp;

My request to you is this: **If there’s ever something that you know about this community that you think would be important for everyone else to know, please reach out and let me know\!**

Additionally, if there is a topic you’d like me to research and talk about in a future video, including a guest speaker you believe would be beneficial, you’re encouraged to alert me of that as well.

Thank you all so much for watching our videos. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us at 407-956-6165 or send an email to [mark@themarkrameygroup.com](mailto:mark@themarkrameygroup.com).&nbsp;

Hope to hear from you soon\!

Mark Ramey
