<p style="text-align: center;"><em>There actually is a “right” time to sell your home—but when that is might surprise you.</em></p>

“When the best time of year to sell my home?”&nbsp;

I’ve been asked this question many times by sellers and those just entertaining the idea of selling their home. Here in the Orlando region, **we enjoy the luxury of not having a seasonally dependent market.** That means we see significant sales throughout the year and aren’t exposed to harsh weather that tends to diminish buyer motivation. Because of this, we don’t hit major lows in sales activity.

When kids are out of school between May and the end of July, we might see something like a 10% spike in our buyer pool, which temporarily drives demand up a bit. Otherwise, **our market remains strong all year long\!**&nbsp;

Therefore, **the best time to sell a home is when it feels right for you.** Whenever that time is, we’ll be here to serve you. It would be a privilege.&nbsp;

If you have any questions or would like to discuss this further, please don’t hesitate to contact us. We look forward to speaking with you\!
