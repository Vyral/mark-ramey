<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Are you thinking about investing in real estate? Here are the things you should be looking for.</em></p>

If you’re thinking about investing in real estate, here are four things to consider that will help you determine whether a property is right for you:

**1. Monthly income.** What will you get each month from the home?

**2. Expenses.** Coupled with the monthly income, these make up your ROI. You’ll want to know the cost of your monthly mortgage, including the taxes and insurance. If you’re purchasing a condo or in an HOA, you’ll also want to know about the pertinent fees.

**3. The property’s current condition.** To give an example, it can easily cost $5,000 to $7,000 to replace an air conditioning system here in Florida. Roofs can be even more expensive. Check to make sure the systems in the home are working properly.

**4. The current tenant situation.** If the property already has tenants, have they paid each month on time? How long is the lease? Can you raise the rent, or is it at a good level already? These are all questions you’ll need to answer.

These are just a handful of tips I wanted to share with you today. If you have any other questions about buying or selling real estate in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
