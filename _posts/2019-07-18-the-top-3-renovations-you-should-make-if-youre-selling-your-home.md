<p style="text-align:center;"><em>If you’re putting your home on the market, there are three types of renovations you can make that will appeal to the most buyers.</em></p>

Did you know that roughly 98% of all buyers prefer move-in ready homes? If you’re putting your home on the market soon, here are the three types of renovations you can make that will turn your home into exactly what these buyers are looking for:

**1\. Add fresh paint to the interior and exterior.** A fresh coat of neutral paint added to the interior of your home can go a long way, and it can also eliminate any lingering odors, which leads me to my next point...

**2\. Install fresh flooring (i.e., carpeting)**. A lot of sellers ask me whether they should add new wooden or laminate floors. Frankly, if you replace your current flooring with clean, neutral carpeting, that will create an appealing scent in your home. The least expensive flooring you can buy will be your best option, depending on your home. If you have an upscale home, you’re better off looking at other options.&nbsp;

**3\. Resolve any deferred maintenance.** I’m talking about any broken windows, holes in the drywall, leaks (or stains from those leaks), etc. The last thing you want is a buyer to notice a hole in your drywall or something similar that will make them question whether you’ve kept your home in decent shape. You don’t want any questions or doubts in their mind before they make an offer.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
