Should you renovate, or should you move? Today we want to help you answer this question, but first, you need to ask yourself, “Why are you renovating?” Most people renovate for three reasons:

**1\. They need more space.** Determine what your needs are, and figure out what would be possible if you renovated your home. Compare the cost of those renovations with the cost of buying a new home.&nbsp;

If you renovate, you will probably have to live through the renovations. I remember having to microwave oatmeal in my master bathroom when we updated our kitchen.

**2\. They want an updated home.** Go through the same steps in No.1, but this time, determine if your home can be updated how you want. If you want something like a larger pool, it might not be possible in your current home. If the updates are possible, compare the cost to homes with the desired features.

**3\. They want the maximum return on their investment.** Some people plan on moving and want to renovate to get the best price for their home.&nbsp;

We’re happy to do a condition consultation. We’ll tell you the least you have to do to maximize the value of your home. We don’t want you to spend money unless you’re going to get a return, and most of the time, that doesn’t include large changes.

If you have any further questions or would like to schedule a condition consultation, please feel free to call or email us. We would love to hear from you.
