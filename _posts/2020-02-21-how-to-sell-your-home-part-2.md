I’m explaining the four Ps and how they’ll help get your home sold.

This message is part two in our series about both what to and not to do when selling your home. There are four Ps my team and I do to help our clients sell their houses:

**1\. Price.** When we price your property correctly for the market, we drive buyers to that listing. The more buyers that show up, the more opportunities a seller has. That means there’s a greater chance the seller will receive multiple offers, which puts them in a position of strength to negotiate.&nbsp;

**2\. Promotion.** We want to promote your home aggressively. We will do everything we possibly can to benefit your sale. I belong to a network of the top 1% of all real estate agents in the U.S., this means we’re receiving highly qualified, motivated buyers who want to buy your house. These buyers will pay a fair retail price.

**3\. Presentation.** A lot of this step is up to you. You’ll need to prepare your property by painting, fixing things, and making it look fresh. Sometimes this requires calling in a professional stager.

**4\. Prospect.** We prospect every day proactively. We’re searching for the ideal buyer for your home.&nbsp;

When these four Ps come together they translate into wonderful results for you, your wallet, and your move. When selling your house, always remember the four Ps.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions about the selling process or real estate in general, please contact me by phone or email. I would love to help you.
