<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Don’t just hire the first agent you talk to and have them sell your home. Ask them these questions first.</em></p>

When you’re making a decision on who the right agent is to help you sell your home, here are a few questions that you should be asking to make sure:

**1. How long have you been in the industry?** This gives insight into the level of experience that an agent has.

**2. What is your track record?** How long does it take them, on average, to sell a property?

**3. How many homes have you sold in the last six to 12 months?**

**4. What’s your list-to-sale price ratio?** This number will give you an idea as to how much money you’ll actually receive when selling your home.

**5. Do you have enough staff to support my needs?** With the support of my team, I’m able to be out in the field working with buyers and sellers every day to get the results. Agents who don’t have a team of professionals often don’t have the time, resources, and experience necessary to bring you results in the timeline you’re looking for.

**6. Do you have a preferred vendor list?** This includes vendors who can provide you a high level of service that the agent has already vetted.

Hopefully these tips will make the process of choosing your agent much easier. I would love to apply for the job. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
