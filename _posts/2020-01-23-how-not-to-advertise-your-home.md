Today I’m sharing some examples of horrible advertising that we will never use for your home. Join us for some laughs at these awful ads.

Today I’m sharing bad advertising that I promise we will never use when marketing your home. Starting at 0:15 in the video above, see some examples of some truly atrocious advertising.&nbsp;

**These real for sale signs say:**

* “For the love of God, would someone buy this house?\!” These owners sound a little desperate, huh?
* “Zombie Free\!” It’s critical in today’s world to think about safety.&nbsp;
* “Owner ready to croak, must sell.” They should probably get that person to the emergency room...
* “House for sale because my neighbor’s an asshole\!” How do they really feel?
* “Husband left us for a 22 year old. House for sale by slightly bitter, newly single owner.” I’m not sure I want to hear the rest of that story.
* “For sale, mice included.” What else does this house come with?
* “New flats for rent: 2 rooms + hall + 1 bathroom + chicken.” A new pet comes with this rental, how thoughtful\!
* “Wraparound porch, storm/wine cellar, spectacular room to grow marijuana, open floor plan.” In case recreational marijuana ever becomes legal in Florida.&nbsp;
