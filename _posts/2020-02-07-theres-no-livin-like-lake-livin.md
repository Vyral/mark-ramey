<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s the lowdown on lakefront living in the greater Orlando area.</em></p>

Here in Orlando, Florida, we truly do have some beautiful lake properties to offer. The one lake that everyone knows about is the very same people like to walk around in downtown Orlando: Lake Eola.&nbsp;

**Near Eola, you have condo living with some gorgeous high-rises** offering stunning views and access to entertainment, limitless shopping options, and fine restaurants.&nbsp;

In the Winter Park chain of lakes, there are six total lakes right in and around Rollins College and downtown Winter Park. Here, a variety of condo living options will provide you with easy access to all of them. There are also both residential and high-end luxury homes in those areas.

Toward the eastern part of Orange County, there’s the Conway chain of lakes, consisting of four total **lakes with some historical home sites and very reasonably priced lakefront properties**. There’s also easy access to the airport from this area.&nbsp;

In the Butler lakes (13 total), there are Dr. Phillips communities/areas like Turtle Creek and the Bay Hill Country Club, and Windermere communities like Keynes Point and Isleworth, each a high-end golf community.&nbsp;

In College Park, you have Lake Fairview and Lake Silver, which lies in Seminole County. That county alone offers seven other wonderful lakes, Lake Brantley, Lake Jesup (note: the quantity of alligators in this one makes swimming an ill-advised activity), Lake Monroe (part of the St. Johns river system), Lake Oriental in Altamonte Springs, Lake Mary, Lake Howell, and Bear Lake in Apopka.&nbsp;
