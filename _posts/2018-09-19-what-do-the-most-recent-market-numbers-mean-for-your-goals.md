Our third-quarter market update for 2018 is here, so let’s examine how recent real estate developments may impact your goals.

Our third-quarter market review for 2018 holds good news for homeowners.

Right now, inventory is at a seven- to 10-year low. There were 9,794 homes on the market last month, and, of those, 3,510 sold. This tells us that about 36% of the available homes in our market are selling each month, leaving us with a 2.8-month level of supply.&nbsp;

**Given that a six-month supply is required for a balanced market, our current inventory levels put sellers in the driver’s seat.**&nbsp;

In fact, listings are spending an average of just 46 days on market, and are selling for 90% of asking price.&nbsp;

However, while rising inventory is good for homeowners, current conditions have created a challenge for today’s buyers. Our own team is currently working with five great families who are searching for the right property to call their next home.&nbsp;

With this in mind, we have an important question for you: **Who do you know who could benefit from selling their home?** If anyone comes to mind, please connect them with us.
