<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Today we’re answering some common questions about probate.</em></p>

As I’ve progressed in my real estate business, I’ve had the privilege to help a lot of people, many of whom are families that have experienced loss. They went through the probate process in order to sell the deceased person’s properties. Today I’m here with Chris Jones, an attorney from the Giles & Robinson Firm, to discuss the probate process and help answer some common questions about it.

**What is probate?**

When somebody dies while owning an asset that needs to be transferred, probate is the process of finding out what assets there are, which creditors are involved, and ultimately getting those assets to the beneficiaries of the estate.

**How long does the probate process take?**

Many factors affect how long it takes. One that we can’t change is the 90-day creditor claims period, wherein we must wait before we can even consider making a distribution. Most of the time, if there’s nothing too complicated and everyone gets along, a five- to six-month process is fairly quick, all things considered. However, the process can take much longer if the estate is in a lawsuit or there’s a battle with creditors.

We hope that you find this information helpful.
