About 3 years ago this month, Derek and I went out to Wyoming to help Derek’s parents<br>remodel a bathroom. Derek’s parents are very handy but they needed some help moving things around.<br>While we were there, one of their neighbors gave Derek a bag of sunflower seeds that they had<br>harvested from their sunflower garden. The bag included a large variety of different colored seeds.<br>Each one would grow a different type of sunflower.<br>The next spring Derek decided to plant the seeds and put in his first sunflower garden. Our<br>exchange student at the time was Michi, from Sardinia Italy. Derek asked Michi to help him get the<br>seeds started in some small starter pots. Planting seeds was completely new to Michi. He was<br>fascinated when Derek explained that all the information and energy required to grow a 6 to 7-foot<br>sunflower was in those tiny seeds. All they needed was some good soil, water, sunlight and someone to<br>take care of them. You forget that knowing how things grow is something you learn. I’m pretty sure<br>Michi thought that vegetables and flowers came from a market.<br>The three of us watched the seeds sprout and grow\! By May the planter was full of huge<br>sunflowers of all different varieties. By June the big sunflower heads were drooping down and they<br>were done for the season. Shortly afterwards Michi was heading back home to Sardinia and Derek<br>pulled the sunflowers from the bed.<br>Not long after that I noticed a new sunflower growing in the planter. It had re-seeded itself<br>from one of Michi’s sunflowers. It grew all on its own and bloomed in December\! It was a variety of<br>sunflower that has multiple heads on one stem. They are really beautiful, but top heavy. Derek decided<br>to harvest the seeds from this sunflower since they were obviously pretty tough seeds\! He watched a<br>YouTube video on how to harvest sunflower seeds. It seemed pretty easy, but he didn’t let the seeds dry<br>out long enough and most of them tried to sprout in the plastic bag he was keeping them in. He was<br>able to save a handful of seeds, and he planted them in small starter pots the next February so that he<br>could put them back into the garden bed by early March.<br>They grew beautifully, but as soon as they bloomed, they all fell over because they were all top<br>heavy with the multiple blooms on each stem. Aah yes, there was a reason why the first bag had a<br>variety of seeds, they supported each other. Each one had a quality that made the group better. When<br>it came time to dry the flower heads out before he harvested the seeds, Derek laid them out in the sun<br>on the edge of the planter. I was watching from the window when the squirrels ran off with them\! By<br>the time we had tracked them down they had been picked clean, not one seed left.<br>We had to laugh, even the squirrels knew that too much of one<br>thing isn’t good. So back to the original bag of mixed seeds we went. It is<br>the variety of everything that makes life so interesting. A formal garden is<br>beautiful but a field of wild flowers is breathtaking. There is something<br>profound and very natural about that.<br>Sincerely,
