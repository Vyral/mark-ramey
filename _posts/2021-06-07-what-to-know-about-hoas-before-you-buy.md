Before you buy a home within a Homeowners Association, there are a few things that you should know.

**An HOA is an organization of homeowners that exists in a subdivision, condo community, or townhouse community.** Its purpose is to preserve, maintain, and enhance the condition and value of homes. The community is allowed to charge fees monthly, quarterly, or semi-annually. In Condo Associations, monthly charges are common.

All homeowners within an HOA need to adhere to the by-laws for residents. You’ll want to get a copy of these if you’re buying within a community so that you know what you’ll have to do. **If you don’t adhere to by-laws, rules, or regulations, the association can fine you or place a lien on your property. **

If you don’t like the idea of a Homeowners Association, you don't have to buy a home that’s within one. Keep in mind that although it sounds very heavy, a lot of **people love buying in HOAs because of how well they preserve the value and stability of a community.**

If you have any questions about this topic or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
