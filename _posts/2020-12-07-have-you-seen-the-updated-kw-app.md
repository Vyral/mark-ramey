Here are the new features that have just been added to our KW app.

Perhaps you’re already using my KW real estate app, perhaps you’re not. If you aren’t, I wanted to talk to you about some of the new features that we’ve added.

**To quickly recap, the current version of the app gives you the ability to:**

* Search for over 4 million properties
* Search for rentals
* Do an advanced search
* Contact me
* Access Keller Mortgage services (no lender fees, $1,000 closing credit)

**You still get all of these features with the new, updated app. You also get:**

* More on-demand information&nbsp;
* Direct updates from the MLS every 18 minutes
* The ability to search for homes by school district
* The ability to search for homes by points of interest (shopping, restaurants, parks)
* Keller Coverage—i.e., access to shop and compare insurance policies online
* The ability to track the entire process of buying or selling a home at all times

This update is just another way for us to bring value to you and give you confidence in the service we provide. **To download the new-and-improved KW app, follow [this link](https://app.kw.com/KW1Q9P16Q/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.**

If you have questions for me about the app or anything else related to real estate, feel free to reach out via phone or email. I would love to hear from you.
