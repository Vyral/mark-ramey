Herb Knoll explains to us how his organization, the Widowers Support Network, helps men in need.

There are 2.7 million widowers in America, and 420,000 men become widowers each year. One in every five men will be widowed, and the suicide rate among widowers is three to four times higher than that of married men.&nbsp;

**These are just a few reasons why Herb Knoll began the Widowers Support Network (WSN).** It’s his goal to help the millions of widowers across the world overcome the challenges they face each day. Herb joined me today to talk with us more about his organization.
