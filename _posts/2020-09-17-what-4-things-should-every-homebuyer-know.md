<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here are the four main factors that homebuyers should take into account.</em></p>

Here are four tips that will ensure you are buying the right home for you and your family:

**1\. Affordability.** If you’re getting a mortgage, you’ll want to speak to a lender before you even start looking for homes. They will give you an idea of what your monthly cost will be and what you can afford so you can feel confident and comfortable about which homes fit into your budget when you go out to look at properties.

**2\. Location.** Does the home have access to schools, shopping, recreation, and other places that are important to you and your family? You’ll also want to consider your commute to work. I can't tell you how many clients I’ve sold homes for because they were spending too much time traveling to and from work. Everyone wants a safe location, too. I recommend driving through it during the day and night to get more comfortable with the area.

**3\. Features.** What’s going to be important in a home to you? It could be size, bedroom/bathroom count, or anything else. Consider the yard, the floorplan, and more.

**4\. Condition.** Typically, there are three types of houses. The first is brand-new, move-in condition. These properties are going to be priced at the top end of the market. The second is clean, move-in condition. These homes aren’t priced as high but don’t require any extra work. The third is a house that’s in ill repair. If you buy this kind of home, you’ll either be working on it yourself or managing a contractor, so you’re taking on some extra responsibility in exchange for a lower price.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
