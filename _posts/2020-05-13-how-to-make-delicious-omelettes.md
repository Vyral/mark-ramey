  In respect to our current climate of social distancing we thought that the
  easiest way to minimize points of contact in regards to sending out these
  letters would be to deliver them to you by email for the time being.

        <p style="text-indent: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">So, with the current state of the world I thought a nice sort of funny letter would be appropriate. During the weekends this last school year we would sometimes have one of the other exchange students come over and spend the weekend with Oliver and Thomas. One of their best friends from the exchange program was a young man named Andri from Switzerland. Needless to say, with all of these students in the house the warning sign to the left was appropriate. Derek would even say necessary.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px; margin-right: 40px">Andri was not the kind of young man who watched idly from the sidelines. He was always getting involved with everything going on around him.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 40px; margin-right: 40px">Andri wrote the thank you letter to the left on the back of the above warning sign. His host mother brought it over after he had flown back to Switzerland while he still could.</p>
