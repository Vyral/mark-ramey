Derek and I have been sitting in our garden chairs at sunset the last few evenings in anticipation of the arrival of the baby hummingbirds.&nbsp; We haven’t seen any yet but we have seen the male hummingbird quite a few times already.&nbsp; The male hummingbird has a red ring around its throat that identifies it as a male.&nbsp; We normally see the male hummingbird first because they arrive before the female to secure an area for their nest.&nbsp; Hummingbirds always return to where they were born so somewhere around our home there are quite a few hummingbird nests.&nbsp;&nbsp;

We have never seen one of the nests but we know that they are very small because a hummingbird egg is the same size as a coffee bean.&nbsp; They normally hatch two eggs per spring.&nbsp; I have written about this before because last spring we had so many baby hummingbirds in the garden at one time that we couldn’t count them all.&nbsp; They normally all descend on a grouping of pink porterweed plants that sits next to our garden chairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The name porterweed intrigues me because normally I don’t think of flowering plants (other than dandelions) as being weeds.&nbsp; I decided to look up what the difference is between a flower and a weed and there are a lot of opinions out there on that subject.&nbsp; It seems easier to identify characteristics of weeds than it is to outright scientifically say “this is a weed because…”

I read that the difference between a weed and a flower can come down to nothing other than whether or not the plant is wanted in the garden.&nbsp; Derek would agree with that idea.&nbsp; If he didn’t put it there, it is a weed.&nbsp; More general characteristics include that they grow rapidly, produce many seeds and disperse seeds over a wide area.&nbsp; They tend to be invasive and cause the most damage when they use up resources from other plants.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now porterweeds are called weeds because they grow rapidly, produce many seeds and spread out everywhere.&nbsp; They also attract more hummingbirds and butterflies than almost any other plant that grows in Florida.&nbsp; That is why Derek put them into the garden.&nbsp; That weed, being allowed to do what it naturally does, creates a better center piece of a hummingbird/butterfly garden than any flower could.&nbsp;&nbsp;

It seems to me that trying to determine if a plant is a weed or not comes down to more of an opinion than science.&nbsp; That is pretty important because in my head, weeds are bad and flowers are good.&nbsp; I know that is overly simple but I have believed that my whole life, even though my direct experience with the porterweeds has been nothing but good.&nbsp; It just makes me think that I have been putting too much weight on what something is called and not enough weight in the intrinsic value everything and everyone brings to my experience.&nbsp; So, I have decided to take my cue from the hummingbirds.&nbsp; I am going to focus less on opinions, even my own, and spend more time enjoying the garden just as it is.&nbsp;

Sincerely – Mark Ramey
