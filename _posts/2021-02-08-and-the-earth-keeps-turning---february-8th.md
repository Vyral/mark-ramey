I have been working in my make-shift home office in my back guest bedroom for almost 10 months. &nbsp;In that 10 months I can tell you without a doubt that the best part of this room is the window overlooking the garden. &nbsp;There are other good aspects of working from home, the 4 second commute in the morning, the cats sleeping on my files, access to the snacks in the pantry, just to name a few. &nbsp;The window though is something altogether different. &nbsp;The window is, in a way, magical. &nbsp;

I have another window in my office at Keller Williams. &nbsp;It isn’t quite as good. &nbsp;It overlooks Universal Studio’s Volcano Bay Water Park. &nbsp;My office there is on the second floor so I am looking directly across the street at the second and third tier of steps for one of the big water slides in the park. &nbsp;The park is currently closed so I am not missing anything good but I often wondered before, if any of those vacationers were looking back across that street through my window and saying, “Wow, that real estate agent is really working hard.” &nbsp;Probably not exactly what they were saying, but, maybe……

The window in my home office doesn’t have a view of a water park. &nbsp;It just overlooks a garden. &nbsp;In the last 10 months I have seen mammoth sunflowers literally turn completely around and follow the sun from dawn to dusk. &nbsp;I have watched baby hummingbirds grow and become completely independent from their parents. &nbsp;I have seen crepe myrtles go from bare sticks to lush greenery, then to full bloom and back to sticks. Do you see what I mean? &nbsp;True magic. &nbsp;

Just recently I looked out the window and saw a robin. &nbsp;I have seen robins before as they migrate every year, but I hadn’t really ever thought about how wonderful it is to be able to see these primarily northern birds for a few days as they pass through. &nbsp;I looked it up and robins can migrate from as far away as Vancouver, Canada and go as far south as Guatemala. &nbsp;They travel on average about 38 miles a day, but they can travel 100 to 200 miles a day in good conditions. &nbsp;They migrate along the 37 – degree isotherm, which means they use the angle of sun to know where they are on the earth. &nbsp;Their entire migration is instinctive. &nbsp;They are born knowing how to survive and somehow the water in our bird bath is part of that process. &nbsp;I am so happy about that part of the process.&nbsp;

Sitting in my home office I see, hear and read about so many really difficult things that are happening pretty much everywhere. &nbsp;But I remember to look out the window every now and then to remind myself that I am not just observing a cycle of life, I am in a cycle of life. &nbsp;The same awareness in a sunflower that turns its head toward the sun is in me. &nbsp;The same instinct that moves a robin from one side of the continent to the other is in me. &nbsp;And my instincts tell me to have faith in the process and know that all cycles come and go. &nbsp;It took looking through a different window to give me a new perspective. I’ve decided I am going to keep looking toward the light.&nbsp;
