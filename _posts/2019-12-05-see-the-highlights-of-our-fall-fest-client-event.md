Our Fall Fest Client Event was a smashing success, and we want to show you the highlights.

As you know, we recently held our Fall Fest Client Appreciation Event at the Orange County Sportsman Associate on Lake Sheen, and we’re proud to say it was a huge success.

We had around 60 guests stop by and we provided plenty of BBQ and entertainment for the whole family to enjoy. On that note, we want to congratulate the winners of our cornhole tournament, Doug Smith and Ammer Khan, and the winners of our Bingo tournament, **\[INSERT NAMES\].**&nbsp;

You can check out all the photos we took of this event [here.](https://www.flepv.com/p292540445) If you came, we were glad to have you join us. If not, we hope to see you at our next client event. In the meantime, if you have any real estate needs at all, call or email us anytime. We’d love to help you.
