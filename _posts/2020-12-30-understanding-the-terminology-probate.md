<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Unpacking all the complicated terms surrounding the probate process.</em></p>

John Anker is an attorney from the Law Office of Saunders & Anker, and among other things, **John specializes in probate, so today I sat down with him to discuss the probate process.** For example, what exactly *is* probate? Simply put, it’s the process of taking a property that belonged to a now-deceased person and distributing it to that person’s heirs or beneficiaries via the court system. 

Hopefully, you’ll take away some valuable information from our discussion. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to the Mark Ramey Group. We’d love to hear from you.
