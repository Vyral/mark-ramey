Today let’s talk about the home-selling process and what we can do to ensure that it’s smooth, easy, and efficient for you.

The first thing we suggest is that you **meet with an agent and schedule a consultation.** The purpose and goal of the consultation are to understand your needs, wants, timeline, and motivations for moving.

Part of this initial meeting will be a condition consultation. The most important thing is that you understand the least you have to do to your home so that you can receive the greatest financial benefit. We don’t want you to do anything to your home that won’t get you a return on your investment. All this is done so that you know the fair market price of your home and can get the top price.

Next in the process is the **showing stage**. The goal for a seller is to have as many showings as possible. The more showings you have, the more offers you’ll receive. Ideally, you would receive multiple offers at the same time which would allow you to negotiate from a place of strength.

Once you have a good offer, we have to get through the contract process. The timeline for this stage typically takes between 30 and 45 days to complete. During this portion, we’ll go through the contingencies of the contract.

The first of these is the inspection contingency. The buyer will have an inspector come out to look at the property to make sure it’s in good condition. We’ll negotiate with the buyer to request as little as possible to get you the most from your sale.

The next contingency to consider is the appraisal. Typically, appraisals are done within two weeks from when your contract begins. After that, the next milestone to hit is the final loan commitment. Then, we’ll get you to a closing agent, title company, or an attorney of your choice to do your closing. **At closing, the best part happens: You receive a check or a wire transfer directly into your account.**

This is only a brief overview of the selling process; there’s a lot more that we could talk about. If you have any questions, please feel free to give us a call. We look forward to speaking with you.
